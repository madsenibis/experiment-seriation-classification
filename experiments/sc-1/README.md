Calibration experiment -- how reliably can we recover basic features of CT within a regional metapopulation with seriation?

Goal:  recover simple chronological order


Composed of:

* Three time slices, with two nodes per time slice
* Use of the complete sample of assemblages, traits sampled to give 500 samples of simulated data
* Low innovation rate prior distribution (theta = 0.00005 to 0.0001)
* Low migration fraction prior distribution (migr = 0.05 to 0.1)
