seriation classification experiment #4

Goal:  Generate seriation classification samples from an "approximate nearest neighbor" model, where edges within each slice are biased towards short geographic distances by a negative exponential kernel, and parent/child connections between communities at different times are also biased by the same kernel.


Composed of:

* One network model generated by seriationct-build-spatial-neighbor-network.
* Exponential decay coefficient of 2.5 to create a fairly significant localization effect
* 32 communities per slice
* 10 time slices
* 500 replicates
