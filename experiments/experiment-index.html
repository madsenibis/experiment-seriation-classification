<p>seriation classification experiment #1</p>
<p>Goal: correctly identify two regional network models (which are very different) from the minmax-by-weight seriation solution graphs, using Laplacian eigenvalue spectral distance.</p>
<p>Composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two network models, 50 simulations each.</li>
<li>Model #1 is a &quot;linear&quot; model with 64 subpopulations, fully connected and equally weighted</li>
<li>Model #2 is a &quot;lineage&quot; model with 8 nodes per cluster of communities, fully connected internally, 10% connected externally, which splits into two lineages of two clusters of communities 40% of the way through the simulation.</li>
<li>Simulated assemblages created by resampling to 500, sampling 3 communities per time slice, and filtering out types/classes with fewer than 3 column entries.</li>
<li>Seriations performed with frequency and continuity</li>
<li>Low innovation and migration fractions 0.00001-0.0001, 0.05 - 0.1</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sc-2">sc-2</h1>
<p>seriation classification experiment #1</p>
<p>Goal: examine potential equifinalities among lineage models, depending upon timing and direction of splitting/coalescence. Classifier based upon the minmax-by-weight seriation solution graphs, using Laplacian eigenvalue spectral distance.</p>
<p>Composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four network models, 50 simulations each.</li>
<li>Model #1 is an &quot;early split&quot; lineage model with 8 nodes per cluster of communities, fully connected internally, 10% connected externally, which splits into two lineages of two clusters of communities 30% of the way through the simulation.</li>
<li>Model #2 is an &quot;late split&quot; lineage model with 8 nodes per cluster of communities, fully connected internally, 10% connected externally, which splits into two lineages of two clusters of communities 70% of the way through the simulation.</li>
<li>Model #3 is an &quot;early coalescence&quot; lineage model with 8 nodes per cluster of communities, fully connected internally, 10% connected externally, which coalesces two lineages of two clusters of communities into a single lineage 30% of the way through the simulation.</li>
<li>Model #4 is an &quot;late coalescence&quot; lineage model with 8 nodes per cluster of communities, fully connected internally, 10% connected externally, which coalesces two lineages of two clusters of communities into a single lineage 70% of the way through the simulation.</li>
<li>Simulated assemblages created by resampling to 500, sampling 3 communities per time slice, and filtering out types/classes with fewer than 3 column entries.</li>
<li>Seriations performed with frequency and continuity</li>
<li>Low innovation and migration fractions 0.00001-0.0001, 0.05 - 0.1</li>
</ul>
